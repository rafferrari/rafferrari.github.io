I like laughing with friends, seeing family in Italy and Russia, etymology-based jokes, pop sonnets, trying new food with friends, Xenopus borealis frogsâ€™ clicking sounds, painting watercolor birthday cards, sleepy cats, swimming in the ocean, unwinding a developed roll of film, jogging in nature, exploring new cities, fungi, neuroscience podcasts, babysitting.
